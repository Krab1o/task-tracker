# Task-tracker

This is my first Golang-project.

This is the place where the project was suggested:
https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker

Not sure, if using cobra satisfied the requirement about "not using any 
framework" but otherwise it would be much dummier application. Using cobra
I learned about framework itself and structure of golang projects.

By the way, I'm still confused if my structure good enough or I should change
hierarchy of my files.

Anyway, I'm glad to pass the first project!

Further plans:

1. Add full tag-support
2. Add time consumed for particular task
